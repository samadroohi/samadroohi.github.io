**Welcome to my research blog** where I share insights, findings, and thoughts on **Natural Language Processing**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Uncertainty Quantification**.

## Research Focus

My work spans across several key areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence:

- **ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing**: Language models, text understanding, and generation
- **ðŸŽ¯ Reinforcement Learning**: Exploration strategies, multi-agent systems, and decision making  
- **ðŸ“Š Uncertainty Quantification**: Calibration, robustness, and reliable AI systems
